For the past few months I was self-studying Python using online courses and this is my first code to upload.
To be able to run this code you'll need to download a list of words for the hangman game, or you can make your own list and use it when you are asked to add a path to the words.
You will also need to download termcolor package which you can find here --> https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/
